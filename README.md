# DirectedAndUndirectGraphImplementation
Implementation of directed and undirected graph with Python


The purpose of this project was to not use the built in method and functions python already has built in and instead dig deeper and start from the ground
floor in implementing a data structure with Python. 

Within each .py file (directed and undirected) there is a section of test cases in the "main" method. If a user wanted to modify any of these test cases, that
section will be best utilized. It also a place for creating even more test cases/edge cases.
